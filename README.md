Once the user submit the survey, the name of the best match and a picture will be shown.

### How to find the best friend
To find the best match, a comparison between the current's user score and those from other users is done. 
All the differences are added and the best match will be the one with the least total difference.

## Future developments
There is a bug in the link to show the picture of the best match.
